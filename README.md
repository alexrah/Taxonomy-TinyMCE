Notes
---------------------
- This plugin needs at least WordPress 3.3 to work as it uses the new wp_editor call introduced in WP 3.3.
- This plugin is a inspired by [CategoryTinyMCE](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/categorytinymce/).
- Kevin please use this code to update your, because I realy don't have a clue yet how the who WordPress repo's work...


Install plugin 
---------------------
1 Upload Taxonomy-TinyMCE folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
2 Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3 Go to your custom taxonomy edit pages and start to write!


To Do 
---------------------
- Show tiny_mce on overview page 'edit-tag' page, but it needs some change in the core or Wordpress.
inline-edit-tags.js needs to have .live() to work with TinyMCE.
I was thinking about so submiting a request to add this, but I first have to learn my way in to WP svn / ideas / trac etc. Any help?
